Expanding Card App
This is a personal project of an expanding card app built with Javascript.

Description
The Expanding Card App is a simple application that displays a set of cards that expand when clicked on. Each card displays an image and some text, and expands to show more text when clicked on. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and is designed to be responsive and work on a variety of devices.

Installation
To install the Expanding Card App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can simply open the index.html file in your web browser without cloning the repository.

Usage
To use the Expanding Card App, simply click on one of the cards to expand it and show more text. Click on the card again to collapse it and hide the additional text.

You can customize the app by modifying the HTML and CSS files. The images and text for each card are defined in the HTML file, and the styles for the cards are defined in the CSS file.
